## Technologies used

This assignment is developed using

LESS, HTML5, CSS3, GRUNT 
```

## Tested On
`IE6`, `IE7`, `IE8` , `IE9`, `IE10` , `Google Chrome Ver:35`, `Firefox Ver:30.0`

_In order to make HTML5 work on older browsers `html5shiv.js` is being used. Currently it's being conditionally included for IE8 and below browsers._

_On IE6, the user is shown a message to upgrade his/her browser while hiding the rest of the page content._
